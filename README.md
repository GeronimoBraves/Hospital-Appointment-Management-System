# Hospital-Appointment-Management-System

Systems for scheduling appointments are used by clinics for arranging elective surgeries as well as by primary and specialized care clinics to control access to service providers. The effectiveness of appointment systems is influenced by a variety of factors, including arriving and service time unpredictability. Equal treatment, which is a means of allocating supplies to healthcare in a way that all patients receive, on a typical basis, an equal amount of resources is an important challenge in healthcare. 
In this project, the main aim was to create a flexible appointment system that can schedule all the required appointments on time and assist the users or the patients in accessing all the essential resources that they need. 
The sector can improve management, minimize mistakes, improve treatment outcomes, and more thanks to the introduction of innovative technologies in healthcare. A system that comes from efficient and profitable healthcare services is appointment scheduling. It manages access to healthcare facilities. The scheduling of visits results in patient satisfaction in this way. Appointment scheduling is utilized for initial appointments, single stops by, and alternative operations in a variety of parts

Our project is a visual representation of a systematic system designed for various hospital appointments for patients by interaction through a user-friendly website. Following are the pages that our website contains:

Home page: It is the introductory page of our website which asks for appointment booking from the customers. It includes services and appointments for the required doctors along with their specialities and resources as a navbar link where we can land on the respective page itself. It also contains basic information for welcoming about the hospital and also we can review the options for various appointments of the patients. Further the page contains contact form where we can ask questions , call or email us so that we can provide further information, online forms for our patient which can be completed before you book an appointment, schedule the appointment, look for different departments and meet the doctors, and also the wellness and checkup care option to learn more about it. Last page contains the contact us form where we can give a basic information about your patient's health and at last the clinic hours presented so that no one can miss the appointments and schedule it on a given timing.
Appointment page: The starting page contains the booking of appointments for various doctors with all their data. After selecting the doctor, the next page will ask about the date, timings. It also provides basic data about consultation fees. After selecting the necessary date and slot, the next page asks about the basic client information like the name, email after confirming the doctor details and then a request is submitted.
Services page: This page contains the services which are provided by them to us. The first page contains the need for a checkup. It includes various options in the dropdown list as cardiology, neurology, dentistry, cancer care etc services are available. Also contains blogs on the pages where we can get more information about their services with their benefits as well. Next it contains the appointment request page where we can book an appointment urgently or in an online format by giving the basic details of us with the date and time to be selected by our needs which will submit the message and a database will be noted which can inform us of the appointment. Further it includes the location page where you can choose the nearby location of the hospitals for the betterment, and can also include the phone number which we can directly call and book the appointment.
Blog page: This page is designed to display all the articles, blogs, and notices that the hospital needs to display. This range of posts is divided into several categories, some of which can be further categorized into subcategories. This is displayed as a small navbar on the right side of the page. Selecting any of the categories will load a different list of articles under that specific category. The user can click on any of the articles to read the entire content related to the topic. This page was created to increase interaction of people with the community, as well as find other necessary information related to all the daily activities. We also added a category for helping the users in one of the biggest struggles, that is choosing a doctor. With the importance of hospitals becoming more and more relevant in modern society, this page will help the users keep in contact with fellow doctors.
